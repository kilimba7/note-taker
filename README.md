# Note Taker

  ## Description
  I created this application in order to generate notes that can be tracked through the server. When a user inputs their text and title for the note, then a unique ID is generated. This ID helps when referring back to their saved notes, specifically by being able to pull the saved ones and display them on the right hand side. My biggest challenge also tied in with the IDs, as I was not able to write a route that would delete a note when the user clicks on the garbage icon.
